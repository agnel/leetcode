# [Smallest Good Base](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-good-base/description/)

Let's break down the solution to the "Smallest Good Base" problem step by step, focusing on the mathematical derivations and logic.

### Problem Overview

The goal is to find the smallest integer $k$ such that the number $n$ can be expressed as:

$n = k^m + k^{m-1} + ... + k + 1$

for some integer $m \geq 1$. This sum represents a geometric series.

### Deriving the Formulas

1. **Geometric Series Representation**:
   The sum $n$ can be represented as:

   $$n = k^m + k^{m-1} + ... + k + 1$$

   This is a geometric series where the first term is $1$ and the common ratio is $k$.

2. **Transforming the Equation**:
   From the equation above, we can manipulate it:
   
   $$n - 1 = k^m + k^{m-1} + ... + k$$

   Notice that the right-hand side is again a geometric series, but it can also be factored:

   $$n - 1 = k \cdot (k^{m-1} + k^{m-2} + ... + k + 1)$$

   Thus, we have:

   $$n - 1 = k \cdot \frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} \quad \text{(from the formula for the sum of a geometric series)}$$

   This gives us an important relationship:

   $$k \cdot (n - k^m) = n - 1$$

   Rearranging, we find:

   $$k^{m+1} - 1 = n k - n$$

   or 

   $$\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} = n \quad \text{(Equation [3])}$$

3. **Divisibility Condition**:
   From the above manipulations, we note that $n - 1$ must be divisible by $k$. This is a key insight that will help us reduce the search space.

### Understanding $m$ and $k$

4. **Range for $m$**:
   We need to find valid values for $m$:
   - Since $n > k^m$, we can deduce that:

   $$k < \sqrt[m]{n}$$

   - Additionally, using the binomial theorem, we can say:

   $$n < (k+1)^m \quad \text{(Equation [5])}$$

   This leads to:

   $$k + 1 > \sqrt[m]{n} > k$$

   Therefore, the only candidate $k$ to check is around $\lfloor \sqrt[m]{n} \rfloor$.

5. **Finding $m$**:
   The maximum value of $m$ can be set to $\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor$ because, in the worst case, $k$ could be as small as $2$ (the smallest base) and can lead to the largest $m$.

### Implementing the Code

Now we can implement this logic in the code. We iterate $m$ from $\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor$ down to $2$ (since for $m = 1$, the base would just be $n-1$):

1. Calculate $k$ as $\lfloor n^{1/m} \rfloor$.
2. Check if this $k$ satisfies the equation $\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} = n$.

### Complete Code

Here‚Äôs the provided implementation:

```python
import math

class Solution(object):
    def smallestGoodBase(self, n):
        n = int(n)
        max_m = int(math.log(n, 2))  # Maximum possible value of m
        for m in range(max_m, 1, -1):
            k = int(n**(1/m))  # Calculate k
            if (k**(m + 1) - 1) // (k - 1) == n:  # Check if it satisfies the condition
                return str(k)
        
        return str(n - 1)  # If no valid base found, return n-1
```

### Conclusion

This approach systematically narrows down the search space for valid bases $k$ and exponent $m$ based on mathematical insights derived from geometric series properties. The complexity is efficient due to logarithmic bounds on $m$, making it feasible for large values of $n$.


## Why the maximum value of ùëö can be set to ‚åä log2(ùëõ)‚åã ?

The decision to set the maximum value of $m$ to $\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor$ comes from understanding the relationship between $n$, $k$, and $m$ in the context of the geometric series representation of $n$.

### Reasoning Behind the Bound on $m$

1. **Geometric Series Representation**:
   We know that $n$ can be expressed as:

   $$n = k^m + k^{m-1} + ... + k + 1$$

   This means that $n$ is the sum of a geometric series. The value of this series grows exponentially with increasing $m$.

2. **Minimum Value of $k$**:
   The smallest base $k$ we consider is $2$. Therefore, for $k = 2$:

   $$n \approx 2^m \quad \text{(for large } m\text{)}$$

   This indicates that as $m$ increases, $n$ must also increase exponentially.

3. **Finding Maximum $m$**:
   To find the maximum $m$ that satisfies this relation with $k = 2$:

   $$n \geq 2^m$$

   Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives:

   $$m \leq \log_2(n)$$

   Thus, the maximum integer value of $m$ that still allows the equation $n = k^m + k^{m-1} + ... + k + 1$ to hold is:

   $$m_{\text{max}} = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor$$

### Summary

- The maximum value of $m$ is derived from the fact that if $m$ were larger than $\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor$, the expression $k^m$ (with $k$ being at least 2) would exceed $n$, making it impossible for the equation to hold.
- This logarithmic relationship helps limit the range of $m$ we need to check, allowing for an efficient solution to the problem. 

This reasoning ensures that we are only considering feasible values for $m$ that can realistically correspond to valid bases $k$ such that $n$ can be expressed in the required form.
